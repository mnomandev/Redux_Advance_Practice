## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`
For node modules

### `npm start`
To run the project


### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
